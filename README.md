# ELDB-Binary-image-discriptor
This project introduces ELDB binary image descriptor. This descriptor is used as a global image discriptor for place recogntion applications.
ELDB represents an extenstion to the Local Diffrence Binary (LDB) binary image discriptor that enhances its: ) image matching accuricy, 2) robustness againest apperance changes, and 3) its computional effeciency.



The Demos presented in this project measure the accuricy of ELDB when used for place recgnition by single-image matching. The datasets used are:
1- Alderlay day/night dataset.
2- Surfares Paradise dataset.
3- Highway dataset.
4- CBD dataset.
Each of this datasets contains two videos, one is recoreded at day time, while the other is recoreded at nights. One of the two videos is considered as an image database, while the other is considered as a real-time image-queries.

The videos of the datasets are avilable at the following website of queensland university of technology (QUT):
